# Project Rules

## Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling
- Use **DaisyUI** components and utilities when available
- Prefer DaisyUI components over custom implementations when possible
- Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, colors, and responsive design
- Follow Tailwind's utility-first approach

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: SolidJS
- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **Bundler**: Bun

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow SolidJS patterns and best practices
- Use functional components with signals for state management
- Keep components small and focused

## Component Organization

- **Extract generic/reusable components** into separate files
- Create shared components in `src/components/`
- Reuse components across the application rather than duplicating code

## Testing

- **Every feature must be covered in unit tests**

## Docs

- Information about the project is available inside the /docs directory
- Every new feature must be documented either in new file or in the according file if exists
- Avoid writing code inside docs, you may write very short snippets, function names, api names, etc.
- Save docs inside /docs directory

## Misc

- Always use bun instead of npm
- Always use `bun run test` instead of just `bun test`
- When creating documents and plans, do not include code there
